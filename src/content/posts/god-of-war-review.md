View transitions are no longer behind an experimental flag in Astro v3.0.

If you had not enabled this experimental flag in Astro 2.x, this will not cause any breaking changes to your project. The new View Transitions API has no effect on your existing code.

If you were previously using experimental view transitions, there may be some breaking changes when you upgrade your Astro project from an earlier version.
